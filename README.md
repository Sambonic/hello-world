# hello-world
This is the first time I use github. Even though I feel it is kind of embarrassing to create a repository of that name, I think it's okay to feel small in the beginning of  trying something new. Hopefully with time this profile will flourish into meaning :)

Okay, so starting off, I didn't know what a **markdown element** even is. I always _used_ it, but I didn't know there existed a terminology for it.
